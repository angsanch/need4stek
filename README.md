Create a simple selfdriving car.

Project for semester 2 of the Epitech Introduction to AI module.

### Description

Create a selfdriving car that can complete obstacle courses. The only information available to you is the lidar on the car. Every command you execute takes valuable time, so you have to find a balance between doing adjustments and reading the lidar.
